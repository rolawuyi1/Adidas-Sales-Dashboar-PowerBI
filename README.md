# Adidas-Sales-Dashboard-PowerBI

**Project Overview**

Adidas, a global leader in sportswear, sought to understand its U.S. sales performance for the years 2020 and 2021, to identify high-performing product categories, regional strengths, and sales trends. This Power BI dashboard was created to answer critical business questions using clear visualisations. 

**ðŸŽ¯ Business Problem**

The U.S. sales team at Adidas needed a report to:

â€¢	Measure total revenue, units sold, and profit across multiple dimensions.

â€¢	Understand monthly sales patterns and seasonality.

â€¢	Identify top-performing and underperforming product types.

â€¢	Evaluate sales performance by region, state, and city.

â€¢	Compare store-type contributions (In-store, Online, Outlet).


**ðŸ“Œ Business Questions Answered**


What are the total sales and revenue per unit?

How was retailersâ€™ sales trend over time (monthly)?

Which product categories drive the most revenue and sales?

What is the most preferred method of purchase (store-type)?

Which U.S. states and regions contribute the most to total revenue?

**Key Insights**

â€¢	Men's Street Footwear generated the highest revenue ($208M).

â€¢	Men's Street Footwear had the highest unit sales (593K units).

â€¢	July showed a significant sales peak

â€¢	In-store sales accounted for the largest share of revenue.

â€¢	New York and California were the top-performing states, and the West Region has the highest revenue.

**ðŸ’¡ Recommendations**

â€¢	Invest more in inventory and marketing for high-performing, high-revenue product categories.

â€¢	Review and optimise underperforming product lines to improve profitability.

â€¢	Align future marketing campaigns with the July sales peak to maximise seasonal demand.
